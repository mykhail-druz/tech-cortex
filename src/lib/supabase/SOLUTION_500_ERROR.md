# Comprehensive Solution for 500 Error During User Registration

## Overview

This document provides a complete solution for fixing the 500 error that occurs during user registration in the TechCortex application. The error is caused by issues with the user profile creation process in the database.

## Files Included in the Solution

1. **error_handling_trigger.sql** - Main solution with improved trigger function and setup utilities
2. **create_missing_profiles.sql** - Utilities for creating profiles for existing users
3. **user_profiles_policy.sql** - Required RLS policies for the user_profiles table
4. **README_ERROR_HANDLING.md** - Detailed explanation of the issue and solution

## Step-by-Step Implementation

### 1. Apply the Error Handling Trigger

```sql
-- Open the SQL Editor in Supabase
-- Copy and paste the contents of error_handling_trigger.sql
-- Execute the SQL query
```

This creates:
- An improved trigger function with error handling
- Helper functions to verify database setup
- A setup function to ensure everything is configured correctly

### 2. Run the Setup Function

```sql
SELECT public.setup_user_profiles_system();
```

This will:
- Ensure the customer role exists
- Create necessary RLS policies if missing
- Create profiles for existing users

### 3. Verify the Fix

1. Try registering a new user
2. The registration should complete without errors
3. Check the user_profiles table to confirm a profile was created

### 4. Create Profiles for Existing Users (if needed)

If you have existing users without profiles:

```sql
SELECT public.create_missing_user_profiles();
```

For a specific user:

```sql
SELECT public.ensure_user_profile_exists('user-uuid-here');
```

## Technical Details

### Root Cause Analysis

The 500 error occurs because:

1. When a user registers, they are created in the `auth.users` table
2. A trigger attempts to create a corresponding record in the `user_profiles` table
3. This operation fails due to one or more of the following issues:
   - Missing RLS policies for INSERT operations
   - Missing or incorrect role_id reference
   - Errors in the name parsing logic
   - Exceptions not being properly handled

### Solution Components

1. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Nested BEGIN/EXCEPTION block in the trigger function
   - Detailed error logging
   - Transaction continues even if profile creation fails

2. **Database Verification**
   - Functions to check and create necessary database objects
   - Verification of user roles
   - Verification of RLS policies

3. **RLS Policies**
   - Policy for users to create their own profiles
   - Policy for service role to create any profile

4. **Profile Recovery**
   - Functions to create missing profiles
   - Individual and bulk profile creation utilities

## Troubleshooting

If issues persist after applying the solution:

1. Check Supabase logs for error messages
2. Verify database objects:
   ```sql
   -- Check user roles
   SELECT * FROM user_roles WHERE name = 'customer';
   
   -- Check RLS policies
   SELECT * FROM pg_policies WHERE tablename = 'user_profiles';
   
   -- Check trigger
   SELECT * FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'create_user_profile_trigger';
   ```

3. Try creating a profile manually:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO user_profiles (id, first_name, last_name, role_id)
   VALUES (
     'user-uuid-here',
     'First Name',
     'Last Name',
     (SELECT id FROM user_roles WHERE name = 'customer')
   );
   ```

## Conclusion

This solution provides a robust fix for the 500 error during user registration by:

1. Preventing the trigger from causing transaction failures
2. Ensuring all necessary database objects and policies exist
3. Providing tools to recover from existing issues
4. Including detailed documentation and troubleshooting guidance

After implementing this solution, user registration should work reliably, and user profiles should be created automatically for all new users.
