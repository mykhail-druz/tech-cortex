// Test script for checkout process
// This script simulates the checkout process to ensure that cart items are properly added to orders

// 1. Add items to cart
// 2. Go to checkout
// 3. Authenticate if needed
// 4. Complete checkout
// 5. Verify order creation

// In a real test, this would interact with the UI or API to add items to the cart

// Simulate going to checkout
console.log('2. Going to checkout...');
// In a real test, this would navigate to the checkout page

// Simulate authentication if needed
console.log('3. Authenticating...');
// In a real test, this would handle the login process if the user is not authenticated

// Simulate completing checkout
console.log('4. Completing checkout...');
// In a real test, this would fill out the checkout form and submit it

// Verify order creation
console.log('5. Verifying order creation...');
// In a real test, this would check the database or UI to confirm that the order was created

/*
To manually test the checkout process:

1. Add items to your cart (either as a guest or logged-in user)
2. Go to the checkout page
3. If you're not logged in, you'll be redirected to the login page
   - The cart items should be saved to session storage
4. After logging in, you should be redirected back to the checkout page
   - The cart items from session storage should be added to your user cart
5. Complete the checkout process by filling out the form and submitting it
6. Verify that the order appears in your orders list

The SQL migration file (create_orders_and_order_items_tables.sql) should be run on the database
to ensure that the orders and order_items tables exist with the correct structure and RLS policies.
