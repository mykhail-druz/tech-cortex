### 3. Key Features
- **No API Routes**: Uses direct Supabase client operations
- **Smart Naming**: Auto-generates names based on CPU/GPU/Motherboard
- **User Experience**: Prompts for custom names, shows loading states
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error messages
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing PC Configurator

## Testing Steps

### Manual Testing Required:
1. **Open PC Configurator** (`/pc-builder` or wherever it's located)
2. **Select Components**: Add at least one component to the configuration
3. **Test Save Without Login**: 
   - Click "Save Configuration" without being logged in
   - Should prompt to log in and redirect to login page
4. **Test Save With Login**:
   - Log in to the application
   - Select multiple components in PC Configurator
   - Click "Save Configuration"
   - Should prompt for configuration name with auto-generated default
   - Enter a custom name and confirm
   - Should show "Saving..." state
   - Should show success message and option to view configurations
5. **Test Validation**:
   - Try saving with no components (button should be disabled)
   - Try saving with very long name (should show error)
6. **Verify Database**:
   - Check `/account/configurations` page
   - Should see the saved configuration listed
   - Configuration should have correct name, price, and component count

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Button disabled when no components selected
- ✅ Login prompt for unauthenticated users
- ✅ Auto-generated configuration names (e.g., "Intel Core Build - Jul 28")
- ✅ Loading state during save process
- ✅ Success feedback with optional redirect
- ✅ Error handling for various failure scenarios
- ✅ Configurations appear in `/account/configurations`

## Files Modified:
1. `src/lib/supabase/services/configurationService.ts` (NEW)
2. `src/components/PCConfigurator/ConfigurationSummary.tsx` (MODIFIED)

## Implementation Complete ✅
The Save Configuration functionality is now fully implemented without using API routes, as requested in the issue description.
